== Synchronous TCP Communication Protocol Overview ==
date: 2023-07-08

Box Title: Synchronous TCP Communication Protocol
Creation Date: July 8th, 2023

**Introduction**
Welcome to the Synchronous TCP Communication Protocol Box. This Chat-GPT Box aims to encapsulate the concept of a simple protocol for achieving synchronous communication using TCP. By following the guidelines presented in this box, you can synchronize the execution of processes across multiple machines or instances using TCP as the underlying communication medium.

**Protocol Overview**
The Synchronous TCP Communication Protocol enables coordinated communication between processes by following a series of steps. Here's a brief outline of the protocol:

1. Establish TCP Connections:
   - Each process establishes a TCP connection with a central coordinator or a designated process responsible for managing synchronization.

2. Initialization:
   - Processes wait for a "go" signal from the coordinator to start their tasks.
   - Blocking receive operations are used to wait for the signal over the TCP connection.

3. Execution:
   - Once a process receives the "go" signal, it proceeds to perform its tasks concurrently.

4. Completion:
   - After completing its tasks, a process sends a "done" signal back to the coordinator using a send operation over the TCP connection.

5. Coordinator's Role:
   - The coordinator keeps track of the "done" signals received from all connected processes.
   - It waits until it receives "done" signals from all the connected processes.

6. Next Round:
   - Once the coordinator has received all the "done" signals, it sends out another "go" signal to initiate the next round of processing.

**Benefits and Considerations**
The Synchronous TCP Communication Protocol offers several advantages:
- Simple and easy-to-understand protocol for achieving synchronization between processes.
- Leveraging TCP allows for universal compatibility across various programming languages and platforms.
- Enables coordinated execution and orderly processing of tasks.

However, there are some considerations to keep in mind:
- This protocol assumes a reliable network environment since TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery of data.
- It is essential to handle TCP connection management, error handling, and timeouts appropriately in real-world implementations.
- For more advanced features such as fault tolerance or load balancing, additional mechanisms or protocols may be required.

**Conclusion**
The Synchronous TCP Communication Protocol Box provides a concise explanation of a simple protocol for achieving synchronous communication using TCP. By following the outlined steps, you can synchronize the execution of processes in a coordinated manner. Remember to adapt and enhance the protocol as needed based on specific requirements and considerations in your implementation.

By utilizing this protocol, you can harness the power of synchronous communication over TCP, enabling efficient coordination and orderly execution across multiple processes or instances.

Box Title: Synchronous TCP Protocol Design Considerations
Creation Date: July 8th, 2023

**Introduction**
Welcome to the Synchronous TCP Protocol Design Considerations Box. This Chat-GPT Box aims to explore the design considerations for a TCP-based protocol that facilitates synchronous communication and coordination between client processes and a server. By discussing these considerations, we can refine the design of the protocol to meet your requirements.

**Design Considerations**
1. Packet Size:
   - To optimize transmission efficiency and mitigate potential processing complications, it is advisable for the protocol to adopt TCP payload sizes of 536 bytes or lower. This choice is based on adhering to the minimum required IP datagram size of 576 bytes, accounting for the standard 20-byte TCP header and 20-byte IP header. Utilizing smaller payload sizes helps minimize the likelihood of fragmentation and reassembly complexities that can arise when processing larger data frames.

2. Payload Organization:
   - The payload is organized around fixed width fields.  Where human readable text is included, all human readable text is encoded in the ASCII printable characters.  Where there are numbers, they are 4-byte integers, little endian.

3. Client & Server Self-Identification:
   - Clients should include a fixed-width self-identifier, like a 12-byte string, to differentiate and identify themselves. This self-identifier assists in process tracking.
   - The server will also return a self-identifier.  Also 12 bytes.

4. Protocol Versioning:
   - The protocol itself should have versioning capabilities. When a client connects to the server, the client and the server should both announce to one another the protocol version they are using.

5. Basic Messages:
   - The most important basic messages are the "Go" signal (from server to client), the "Received" signal (from client to server,) and the "Done" signal (from client to server)

5. Timeout Handling and Resynchronization:
   - To address timeouts and temporary unresponsiveness, clients can send periodic "still working on it..." signals to the server, indicating that they are still active. The server can respond with an "I'm still aware of you" message, to keep the client informed. If a client times out waiting for a "Go" signal, it can ask the server "Are you still there?", and the server will respond with the same kind of "I'm still aware of you" message.

6. Server Messages:
   - The server can send informative messages to all client processes, such as "this is taking longer than expected," to provide updates and manage expectations.

7. Refusal Message:
   - The server can say to a process, "I'm not going to work with you," and then hang up the connection.
   - The client can do the same.
   - There should be a field with this message, too, in ASCII text.

**Conclusion**
The Synchronous TCP Protocol Design Considerations Box outlines key considerations for designing a TCP-based protocol that supports synchronous communication and coordination. By incorporating features such as self-identification, protocol versioning, timeout handling, and server messages, the protocol can facilitate efficient and reliable interactions between clients and the server.

Box Title: Synchronous TCP Protocol Messages
Creation Date: July 8th, 2023

**Server to Client Messages**

Protocol Version and Self-Identification: When the client connects to the server, the server sends both the protocol version it is using and its own self-identification to the client. This allows the client to ensure compatibility and identify the server in the communication.

"Go" Message: The server sends an individual "Go" message to each client, instructing them to proceed with their tasks concurrently. This message is critical to the protocol and ensures synchronized execution across clients.

Refusal Messages: The server can send refusal messages to specific client processes, indicating that it will not work with those clients. These messages are targeted instructions from the server to the individual clients.

"Are you still there?" Signal: The server can ask the client if it is still there, at any time.

"I'm still here" Signal:  Server Response to "Are you still there?": If the client sends an "Are you still there?" message to the server, seeking confirmation of the connection's activity, the server can respond with an "I'm still here, still aware of you" message. This response confirms that the server is actively maintaining the connection with the client.  The server cand send this message to the client at any time, actually.

Broadcast Messages: The server can send broadcast messages to all client processes. The following are the specific broadcast messages you have chosen to include:

   a. "This is taking longer than expected, please hang on...": This message informs clients that the current operation is experiencing delays but is still in progress. It helps manage client expectations and provides reassurance that the server is actively working on the task.

   b. "Shutting down in N seconds": This message is sent when the server is about to shut down, notifying clients of the impending shutdown and providing a countdown to indicate the remaining time before the server terminates.

   c. "Shutting down due to error": This message is sent when an error occurs that necessitates the server's shutdown. It alerts clients to the error and informs them that the server will be shutting down as a result.

   d. "Ceasing operation": This message is sent when the server is shutting down, not due to an error, but because the operator has decided to shut the program down.


**Client to Server Messages**

Protocol Version and Self-Identification: When the client connects to the server, the client sends its protocol version and self-identification to the server.

Received Signal: The client sends a "Received" signal to the server, indicating that it has received the "Go" signal and is ready to proceed with its tasks.

Done Signal: After completing its tasks, the client sends a "Done" signal to the server, indicating that it has finished its execution.

Still Working Signal: The client can send periodic "Still working on it..." signals to the server, indicating that it is still active and making progress.  This could be in response to an "Are you still there?" message from the server.  Note that the client might not respond quickly, because it is busy.  The client doesn't have to be asked, in order to send the Still Working Signal -- it can do it just because the programmer wanted to make sure that the coordinator knew that the task was still active.

I Am Here But Not Working Message: The client can send a signal to the server saying that it is still there.  This could be in response to an "Are you still there?" message from the server.  Note that the client might not respond quickly, because it is busy.

Are You Still There? Message: If a client times out while waiting for a "Go" signal or while working on its tasks, it can send an "Are you still there?" message to the server, seeking confirmation that the connection is still active.

Client Exit Signal: The client can send an "I'm going" signal to the server, indicating that it is terminating the connection or shutting down.

This box provides a logical overview of the messages exchanged between the server and the client in the Synchronous TCP Communication Protocol. It focuses on the instructions and signals transmitted between the two entities, enabling synchronized communication and coordination.

date: 2023-07-08

Box Title: Conductor.py Server Programming Starter Plan
Creation Date: July 8th, 2023

**Programming Plan Overview**
The Conductor.py Server Programming Plan box outlines the high-level plan for implementing the server software, "conductor.py," responsible for coordinating the "Lockstep" system. This plan includes the following components and considerations:

1. Main Server Loop:
   - Create a while loop that runs continuously until a stop signal is received.
   - Use a try-except block to catch the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception (Ctrl-C) for graceful server termination.

2. Socket Creation and Binding:
   - Import the `socket` module and utilize socket functions for communication.
   - Create a socket object using `socket.socket()` with appropriate family and type.
   - Read IP address and port number from the `config.json` file.
   - Bind the socket using the `bind()` method and print the starting details to stdout.

3. Client Connection Management:
   - Set the socket to non-blocking mode using `setblocking(False)` for responsiveness.
   - Use `accept()` to accept new client connections and handle them appropriately.
   - Maintain a list or data structure to store all client connections.

4. Update Function:
   - Define an "update" function for server-side generated events.
   - Call this function periodically within the main server loop to perform server-specific actions.

5. Message Received Function:
   - Define a "message_received" function for client-side generated events.
   - Call this function when a client sends a message to the server, triggering relevant server actions.

By following this programming plan, you can structure the server code and create spaces for implementing the "update" and "message_received" functions. Additionally, maintaining a list of client connections ensures effective communication and management with all connected clients.
